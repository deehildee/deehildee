## 🧬 Founder, Nrutseab | Skater | Deeptech Explorer | Performance Researcher

### Bio
I'm hilde, founder of [Nrutseab](https://nrutseab.com) – a London-based deeptech startup blending AGI framework, entertainment, lifestyle, and athleticism to explore the limits of the human body.  
As a skater researching performance optimization for international competition and the 2030 Olympic qualifiers, I lead a team exploring how AI can enhance sport and entertainment at the intersection of technology and human behaviour.

- **Elite gymnast (ages 6–12) → Skater (since 2021)**
- Built Charredbox, a seasonal platform for artist performances during COVID.
- Singer-songwriter since age 14, learning from mistakes that fuel my vision.

At Nrutseab, we push boundaries with our flagship AGI framework, **nut**, and the creative collective **LABS** as co-founders. In 2025, LABS debuts alongside the brand with the world-building album **buttermilk town** – inviting all to join the journey.

> Nrutseab launches 100 exclusive apparel pieces via the brand **00:00** and the debut album **buttermilk town** in 2025.  
> Follow [@nrutseab](https://instagram.com/nrutseab), [@nrutlabs](https://instagram.com/nrutlabs), and [@deehildee](https://instagram.com/deehildee) for more.
